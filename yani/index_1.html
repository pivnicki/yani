                            <h2>Our dance school in Dubai is a great option to choose!</h2>
                            <p>
                                In recent years we can undoubtedly see the rapid
                                development of the city in culture and education.
                                Dubai International Dance Festival combines different 
                                dancing schools in Dubai. We give our dancers an
                                opportunity to share their talents with students
                                and dance instructors. Our studio is always well
                                performing its skills in this dance event and other festivals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Different schools offer their own dancing lessons.
                                The range is huge - from Bollywood to Hip Hop, from 
                                ballet to ballroom dancing. You will feel yourself just
                                fine, thanks to everything: the atmosphere, the format 
                                of dancing classes, the other students, your teachers,
                                timetable matching your busy days, etc. You should know 
                                that it is quite important to set some goals and put an 
                                aim of personal achievements. "I want to move because I 
                                like it" - we've often heard that. But isn't that more 
                                interesting to move to the target of learning a particular
                                step or maybe work on the whole dancing technique? 
                                One of the benefits that students get is development
                                of self-control and ability to put higher targets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can join adult dance classes both private and group ones 
                                along with dancing classes for kids. Also we provide the best
                                practices for the students to demonstrate their new skills
                                in showcases, festivals and international competitions. 
                                Almost every semester there is an event hold where you can
                                be a star regardless of level choreography or your age. All 
                                instructors are advanced dancers and qualified teachers who 
                                will make you feel confident and comfortable while improving
                                the techniques and new steps.
                            </p>
                         
                            
                            <p>
                                We are specialized only on ballroom dancing lessons
                                putting all efforts in this gorgeous kind of sport 
                                (we do not give contemporary or modern dancing classes
                                unless it is a part of a show that you have decided to 
                                choreograph privately). As we say, nowadays it is easy 
                                to find plenty of different dancing classes in Dubai
                                and it is necessary to select the style that mostly
                                suits your personality. Ballroom dancing includes a 
                                range of European, Latin and social dances. We have 
                                been often asked why we do not teach only salsa. Well,
                                the answer is because we use interrelated method of
                                teaching and demonstrate the importance and influence 
                                of human physical characteristics to the possible steps
                                and combinations, not just movements to salsa music.
                                This gives a deeper understanding of the movements in 
                                general and allows to catch the rhythm and structure of
                                any type including salsa. So what we offer is much more
                                than what can be expected.

                            <p>
                                We are one of the first professional dancing schools
                                in Dubai which had started to offer wedding dance 
                                classes and has dedicated instructors to choreograph
                                a memorable entrance routine special for each couple. 
                                It is also possible to bring along your bridesmaids 
                                and best men if you wish them to participate in the 
                                show. We promise to be creative and get everyone 
                                involved. Our dance lessons in Dubai are usually 
                                just a beginning of your new activities as a couple 
                                and we hope it will continue to be a part of your life
                                long after your special performance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another advantage that students enjoy is that we have
                                2 convenient locations: Jumeirah Lakes Towers and
                                Business Bay. That way your group classes and private
                                lessons can be attended in different parts of Dubai 
                                regardless of which branch you have joined initially.
                                Both studios were especially designed by an Italian 
                                architect where every detail is performed to bring 
                                comfort and esthetic values. Our administrators are
                                friendly and professional, instructors are all 
                                experienced competitive dancers and teachers are 
                                simply the best. Our target is to create proper 
                                conditions for our students. If they enjoy every 
                                lesson with us we will be happy. Moreover we offer 
                                private dance classes in Dubai, gift certificates,
                                preparation and participation in show cases, events

                            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                            <p>
                                We consider this kind of training as a remedy for
                                the modern society and as a form of art. The studio
                                is the first and the only school in UAE where teachers
                                are still taking part in professional international
                                competitions and are listed in the World Dance Council 
                                (WDC) rating list of professionals. There is no 
                                Ballroom Dance Sport Federation in the UAE and 
                                that is the reason why there are no professional 
                                tournaments organized here, so our teachers travel 
                                a lot to attend important seminars from their 
                                coaches and to represent Serbia in competitions 
                                organized by WDC. It is important that our instructors
                                are continuously improving their own skills and upgrading 
                                their knowledge because ballroom choreography 
                                technique is progressing each year and even changing in
                                some steps. It is essential to keep up with the latest
                                updates and bring it to each of our dancing classes in
                                Dubai. Besides, we pay a lot of attention to maintain 
                                our high standards in overall studio running.

                                first ones to represent UAE in the International Pro/Am
                                competitions including Austrian World Masters 2013, 
                                Italian Open Championship 2013, Serbian Open 
                                Championships 2014, and Crown Cup 2014.

                                We regularly host show case parties so that students 
                                have a chance to invite their friends and family 
                                members to see them performing. Our younger students
                                are often starring at school performances and social

                                    practicing with them more than two years. All
                                    instructors are glorious - really patient, great 
                                    fun and extremely talented. It’s wonderful to have
                                    trainings in their new studio in Downtown. It is
                                    such a good feeling to forget work and all your 
                                    troubles and just have fun learning a new technique.”

                                    music every moment. You can get the rhythm of the 
                                    music! Besides, I have met a lot of wonderful people.
                                    After lessons with my teacher Arseniy, I feel myself
                                    as a professional! After just one month I learned many 
                                    specific things about dancing. I also met my partner at
                                    DS JLT and I enjoy practicing with her! She is dancing
                                    better than me but I believe I can achieve her level soon.”

                                    started learning in this studio I have not only found 
                                    a new passion but I found also a place with amazing
                                    teachers, dedicated professionals and if it was not
